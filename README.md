--- STEP 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the scraping.py file for the web-scraping procedure on the https://news.tabularazor.org/ website.
This allows for retrieving all date used within the analysis, which should take a little over 1 hour.


--- STEP 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The analysis.py file is used for performing the anlaysis of the data retrieved from webscraping. When runn-
ing this file without having performed the webscraping first, it is important to have the resultScraping.csv
in the ResultCSV folder that is within the zip file as the the analysis.py calls upon this folder to retrieve
the csv script from. The Graphs resulting from the analysis are stored within the Graph folder that is also
already present within the Zip file.

This analysis produces several plots and dataframens and should take about 11 minutes to run.
